# PREDICTING-EMPLOYEES-UNDER-STRESS-FOR-PRE-EMPTIVE-REMEDIATION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS
PREDICTING EMPLOYEES UNDER STRESS FOR PRE â€“ EMPTIVE REMEDIATION USING MACHINE LEARNING  ALGORITHMS


Predicting means identifying employees who are likely to experience high stress level in future and implementing interventions to mitigate those stressors

And the pre emptive remediation means taking proactive measures to address problems before they occur

Once the predictions are made pre emptive remediation strategies can be put in place to reduce stress.

In today's work environment, employee stress has become a significant concern for organizations. High level of stress can lead to decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, reduced job satisfaction and negative impacts on overall employee wellbeing. 

The project aims to achieve several key objectives such as.. it seeks to improve employee wellbeing by identifying individual who are at risk of experiencing high stress levels and implementing pre-emptive remediation...

**Algorithms:**
In the provided Django project code, several machine learning algorithms are used for predictive modeling and classification tasks. Here's a list of the algorithms used in the code:

1. Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB):
   - Algorithm Name: MultinomialNB
   - Usage: Used for text classification tasks.
   - Description: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm often used in text and document classification. It's based on Bayes' theorem and is particularly suited for handling text data.

2. Support Vector Machine (SVM):
   - Algorithm Name: LinearSVC (Linear Support Vector Classification)
   - Usage: Used for binary classification tasks.
   - Description: SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that finds a hyperplane that best separates data points into different classes. LinearSVC is a variant of SVM for linear classification.

3.  Logistic Regression:
   - Algorithm Name: LogisticRegression
   - Usage: Used for binary classification tasks.
   - Description: Logistic regression is a linear classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome. It's widely used for binary classification problems.

4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
   - Algorithm Name: KNeighborsClassifier
   - Usage: Used for both classification and regression tasks.
   - Description: KNN is a simple and effective algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors. It can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

5. Decision Tree Classifier:
   - Algorithm Name: DecisionTreeClassifier
   - Usage: Used for classification tasks.
   - Description: Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. They split the dataset into branches based on features to make predictions.

These algorithms are applied to a dataset for the purpose of predicting employee stress levels based on various features. The code includes model training, evaluation, and the calculation of accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports for each algorithm. Additionally, it saves the results to a CSV file named "Results.csv."

Please note that the code also involves data preprocessing steps, such as text vectorization using CountVectorizer, and the use of Django for web application development and visualization.
