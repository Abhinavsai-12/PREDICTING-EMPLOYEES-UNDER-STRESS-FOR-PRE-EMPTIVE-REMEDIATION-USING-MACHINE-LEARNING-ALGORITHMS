step-1:  Install Python,Xampp in our PC 

Step-2: Extract Project Zip File at particular location

Step-3: 

go to xampp on the apache & mysql server
next in mysql server go to admin and import the dataset which is present in the path: E:\project\Predicting_Employees_Under_Stress\Predicting_Employees_Under_Stress\Predicting_Employees_Under_Stress\Database

then hit the go button which is present in below and minimize it


Step-4: open command promt and set path at which project file (manage.py) is located and install below this commands to install libraries

pip install django==2.2.13 --user
pip install  --only-binary :all: mysqlclient --user

pip install numpy==1.18.1
pip install matplotlib==3.1.3 
pip install pandas==0.25.3 
pip install scikit-learn
pip install xlwt

The libraries you've listed serve various purposes in Python development. Here's a brief overview of their uses:

1. **Django (v2.2.13)**:
   - A high-level Python web framework for building web applications.
   - Used for creating web applications with features like user authentication, database management, and more.

2. **mysqlclient**:
   - A MySQL database connector for Python.
   - Used for interacting with MySQL databases from your Python applications.

3. **numpy**:
   - A library for numerical operations in Python.
   - Used for mathematical and logical operations on arrays and matrices, which is particularly useful in scientific and data analysis tasks.

4. **matplotlib**:
   - A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
   - Used for creating charts, plots, and graphs to visualize data.

5. **pandas**:
   - A library for data manipulation and analysis.
   - Used for working with structured data (e.g., data frames), data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

6. **scikit-learn**:
   - A machine learning library for Python.
   - Used for building and training machine learning models for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and more.

7. **xlwt**:
   - A library for writing data and formatting information to Excel files (XLS format).
   - Used for generating Excel files from Python programs.

Each of these libraries is valuable for different types of Python development tasks. For example:

- If you are building a web application with a MySQL database backend, you would use Django for the web framework and mysqlclient for database interaction.

- If you are working on a data analysis project, you might use numpy for numerical operations, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib for data visualization.

- If you are developing a machine learning application, scikit-learn is a powerful tool for building and evaluating machine learning models.

- If you need to generate Excel reports or work with Excel data, xlwt can be used to create Excel files.

Remember that the specific use cases for these libraries can be much more complex and varied, but this overview should give you a general idea of their purposes. Depending on your project's requirements, you may use one or more of these libraries to achieve your goals.

Step-5: run the main file in cmd:     python manage.py runserver

we will get one url we have copy and paste the url in browser to open our application
